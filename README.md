HW_Wireframe

This home consists of an example web page consisting of a header, a navigation section, a body divided in two parts and a footer. <br> 
	
	The body section is the most complicated; the left side is floated left and the right side is floated right. <br> 

	The left side has a section header called "section" and a sub-section for "article", "h1,h2,h3" and "p". <br> 

	Most of the dimensions were handled in percentages in order to manage the re-sizing adaquately. <br>
